# code-katas
This repository contains my solutions to various algorithmic problems with JavaScript. The problems are from [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/), a platform for practicing your coding skills through small, self-contained programming challenges called code katas. 

## What are Code Katas?
Code katas are small, self-contained programming challenges that focus on improving your coding skills through practice. They typically involve writing functions or classes that solve a specific problem, with the goal of finding the most efficient and elegant solution possible. Code katas can cover a wide range of topics, from basic data structures and algorithms to more advanced concepts like machine learning and cryptography.

At Codewars, each kata is assigned a difficulty level ranging from 8 kyu (easiest) to 1 kyu (most difficult). The platform supports over 20 programming languages, so you can choose which language you want to use when solving a kata.

## How to Use This Repository
This repository contains a folder for each difficulty level, with each folder containing a folder for each kata. Each kata folder contains a README file with a description of the kata and a JavaScript file with my solution. 

## Folder Structure
```bash
├── 8-kyu
│   ├── kata-name
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   └── kata-name.js
│   └── ...
